        		<h3>Helping technology companies go from $0 to hypergrowth</h3>
        		<h2>What does High Gravitas do?</h2>
				<p>High Gravitas provides consulting, advising and investment to high-growth technology companies. Our focus, across consulting, advising and investing, is to help startups from company formation through first revenue and beyond with all things related to sales and go-to-market.</p>
				<h2>Why do we do it?</h2>
				<p>It's hard enough for founders to build scalable products, hire and retain talented employees and raise capital to deliver on a mission of solving hard problems. Layer on top finding product/market fit and scaling sales in an operationally efficient way and it's no wonder 90+% of all startups fail.</p>
				<p>We've lived and breathed startups from company formation to raising multiple rounds of venture funding and scaling revenue from $0 to $10s of millions per year. Because we know how hard it is, helping companies that are finding product/market fit scale out their revenue efforts is incredibly gratifying.</p>
				<h2>How can we help?</h2>
				<p>We've helped startups across a range of areas in sales, marketing, partnerships and operations. Some examples include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Implementation and development of initial sales processes and best practices.</li>
						<li>Development of sales strategy including tactical elements such as pricing, presentation materials and enterprise deal structures.</li>
						<li>Sales team construction and commission plans.</li>
