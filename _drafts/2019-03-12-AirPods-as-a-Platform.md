## AirPods as the next platform

*I drafted this post before the [news today](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18274040/apple-second-gen-airpods-wireless-charging-case-siri-h1) that Apple is releasing AirPods 2 with an updated H1 chip, a wireless charging case, better Siri integration and better battery life. Those updates confirm many of my hypotheses.*

There's been some rumblings from VCs on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/arjunblj/status/1083755361931354112?s=20) and in [blog posts](https://jordancooper.blog/2018/08/29/airpods-as-the-next-platform-and-the-native-applications-therein/) about audio, specifically Apple's AirPods, emerging as the next at scale platform. The anecdotal observation of ubiquity of AirPods in cities like New York and San Francisco paired with the explosion of audio content in the form of podcasts, music and voice-enabled applications make the assertion seem plausible.

Still, AirPods are nascent when compared to the 1.7 billion MAU Facebook boasts or the ~2.5 billion smartphones sold globally. Estimates suggest [~30 million AirPods](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/03/apple-will-launch-new-airpods-in-2019-sales-expected-to-grow.html) will be sold this year and an installed base of ~40 million or so. So ~70 million+ AirPods users in 2019 is a nice installed base, but a far cry from established platforms. 

## What needs to happen?

Here are a few things that probably need to happen in order for AirPods to gain broad adoption and what that might enable.

**1) Form Factor**

The AirPods form factor is pretty good, but it's not a great fit in-ear for every person and some people think they're aesthetically not great. Apple is typically pretty ruthless on refining and optimizing hardware design so the expectation is that this will change over time.

AirPods 2 will be shipping in April 2019 and the form factor will not see a major update. If you project a bit further out to AirPods 3 and 4, it's not crazy to imagine a more "in-ear" form factor that will lend itself to near-constant wear. Many AirPods users already keep theirs in for hours during the day. Assuming future versions of AirPods are close to unobtrusive, that number should only increase.

**2) SiriKit and a public API**

AirPods currently lack a public-facing API for access to features that the W1 chip enables such as tap controls or the custom accelerometer that handles graceful hand-off between native iOS apps like the phone or Siri. The new H1 chip that will be in AirPods 2 provides hands-free "Hey Siri" support which should prompt a major uptick in usage of Siri from AirPods users.

In addition to publishing an AirPods API, Apple will need to better support SiriKit. The battle between Google, Amazon and Apple for voice leadership is hotly contested. Amazon apparently has over [50,000 3rd-party](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/02/the-number-of-alexa-skills-in-the-u-s-more-than-doubled-in-2018/) skills for Alexa. It's not clear how many Siri-enabled 3rd-party apps are in the wild, but it's safe to safe it's fewer than 50,000.

Perhaps AirPods 2 with frictionless "Hey Siri" support will encourage Apple to further develop this ecosystem to catch up to Amazon.

**3) Additional native features**

If Apple decides to go "all-in" on AirPods, the imagination runs wild with the type of additional features that can be included. Some ideas that come to mind.

- *Auditory push notifications.* Hard to imagine this done elegantly, but there is utility here. You're listening to a podcast walking to your next meeting and your weather app let's you know it's about to rain. Your calendar tells you it's time to turn off the tunes and dial into the conference call.
- *Game Center for audio*. Arguably one of Apple's primary (failed) efforts at a social network has been Game Center. Jordan Cooper, in [his excellent post](https://jordancooper.blog/2018/08/29/airpods-as-the-next-platform-and-the-native-applications-therein/) about AirPods as a platform, theorizes that "shared audio presence" could be a compelling feature for a social network. Imagine enabling a way for you to listen to the same podcast or the same song on Spotify with your friends, acquaintances or people you follow on Twitter who also have their AirPods in. Spotify has some social features here, but a real-time feed of audio tied to what is in your ears *right now* seems compelling.

## **What's next?**

If Apple continues to invest in AirPods, both on the hardware and software side, and embraces 3rd-party development then we could see an audio-first platform emerge. What are some of the types of companies that may be poised to take advantage of this next platform?

**Audio content**

This is already happening of course. Between the meteoric rise of podcasting and the savior of the music industry through streaming, audio content has never been more prevalent. This new platform will make audio-first applications and content much more viable. 

I would expect to see a variety of new content verticals and business models flourish. Some examples include [Dipsea](https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/26/dipsea-raises-5-5m-for-short-form-sexy-audio-stories/), a subscription service for women's erotica or [Luminary](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/03/business/media/luminary-media-podcast-app.html) and [Himalaya](https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/podcast-platform-himalaya-raises-100-million-launches-apps-with-tipping-function-1203130068/), two podcast subscription services attempting to pull off a Netflix-type model.

**Analytics**

As audio gains time spent and advertising dollars make their way onto the medium, tools for analyzing podcast advertising effectiveness and other metrics will become more important. [Magellan](https://www.magellan.ai/) (disclosure, I'm an investor) is leading the way here and I would expect there to be additional innovation from startups and the larger players like Spotify.

**Audio Interactivity**

Siri, Alexa, and Google Home have paved the way for voice interaction with machines in your home. What happens when you truly have a "Her"-type assistant embedded in your ear throughout the day? Apple stands to benefit through Siri, but startups should also be able to build apps on top as well. Especially if there's an easy auditory UX to enable interaction with 3rd-party applications, then all of a sudden the hunting and pecking we do on our iPhones everyday may be replaced by natural-language interaction.

In fact, while Alexa has a 100 million units sold and therefore a bit of a head start, the personal nature (again hat tip Jordan Cooper) of AirPods lends this potential platform as a fundamentally different method of interaction. There will undoubtedly be commonalities ("what's the weather," "what's the news"), but there will also likely be unique interactions enabled based on this being a personal device that's mobile.

This is a space I'm personally very excited about. If you're working on something interesting here, please feel free to reach out on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/tgeisenheimer) or over [email](mailto:tim@highgravitas.com).
