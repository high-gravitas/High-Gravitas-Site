High Gravitas is a reference to a running joke in a series of books by the late [Iain M. Banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_Banks). 

The Culture series, as it's called, recounts stories from within a fictional future timeline for humanity that's "post-scarcity."

In the series, humanity has ceded control of the functioning of society and government to AIs that are orders of magnitude beyond human capability. Frequently these AI "Minds" as they're called are emplaced in extraordinarily powerful spaceships.

The running joke around "Gravitas" is that these Minds don't take the power they're given seriously enough and to bring home that point some of them choose to name themselves sarcastically. As is often the case, [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceFiction/comments/5tfgln/the_culture_whats_the_deal_with_gravitas/) does a good job explaining the gag.

I chose to name my site High Gravitas as an homage to my favorite author and because I hope to inject a little bit of levity into the world of startup/tech consulting, advising, and investing.
