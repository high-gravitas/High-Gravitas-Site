Startup sales is often a mystery especially to founders that have never sold before. It becomes particularly difficult pre- product/market fit or early on in that process. Having been involved at the earliest stages in a number of startups as we found product/market fit and began scaling sales, I have a few recommendations.

As the founder or employee tasked with "sales" early in a company's existence, it's critical to push rapid experimentation across a few dimensions. The key areas to experiment are: 

1. **Problem validation**. Ultimately you don't want to be a solution looking for a problem so a key early task is to validate that the problem your product is solving is truly painful. Experimentation here will provide a valuable feedback loop to product/engineering as you iterate to key in on the right problem to tackle.
2. **Product positioning and value**. Once you've made a bet on the problem it's time to solve it. In each sales call consider A/B testing different positioning and value statements to see how they resonate. 
3. **Narrowing target personas**. At the earliest days of product/market fit you'll have hypotheses on who the likely users and buyers of your product are. Depending on the type of product, the user may not be the actual buyer and the sales process could be somewhat complex vs. transactional. Early on it's fine to cast a wide net, but as you start to refine the problem validation and product positioning you'll also want to key in on the right people to target with you sales outreach. This will help you ruthlessly prioritize your time and ultimately lead to better odds of success at closing initial deals.

Some general advice on executing on the above: put together a set of templated questions that are consistent across calls. If you're iterating on your questions, track which calls had which questions (consider recording your conversations, with permission, to go back and take notes). Being rigorous on note-taking will help immensely as you start to use the feedback loop of initial customer conversations to inform product, engineering and marketing decision-making.
